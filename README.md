# 42 Basecamp

This repository contains coding developed at [42 São Paulo's](https://www.42sp.org.br/) Basecamp (the online version of `Piscine` due to the COVID-19 Pandemic), from 03/29/2021 to 04/17/2021.

## About 42

42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process. The Basecamp, a 20-day C programming bootcamp, is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

## Skills developed at 42 Basecamp

### Hard Skills

    C Programming Language:
    
                The primary language through the Basecamp, from the most basics as dealing with 
                operators, variables, pointers, memory allocation, libraries and more resources 
                to solve challanges and replicate existing standard functions.

    Shell:          
    
                The first two lists are about Shell, going through simple to more complex commands 
                in command line, making you feel more comfortable using the terminal.

    Git:
    
                All projects are submitted to a remote Git repository, so it is essential to learn it 
                since the first moment during Basecamp.

### Soft Skills

    Self-learning and Colaboration:
    
                At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There are no teachers whatsoever, 
                the learning process is based on searching, enquiring your classmates, each student learning at their own pace, 
                helping each other with their knowledge.

    Time management and Resiliency:
    
                You can code 24/7, but there is a lot of work to do, and learning how to manage your time is extremelly important 
                to comply with all the schadule and resiliency for not drowing during the process.
    
    Teamwork: 
    
                On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly chosen by the school's system 
                must collaboratively develop a fully running application. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels 
                while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

    Empathy: 
    
                One of the most practiced soft skills during the whole process. It is important to notice that everyone has difficulties, 
                and it the important to take some time to talk to people and listen to them.
